# Exploring the mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for anabolic resistance in sarcopenia: a computational approach

## Overview
The muscle protein synthesis kinetic model allows for the simulation of leucine-mediated mTOR signaling via insulin- and leucine-independent pathways and protein synthesis in skeletal muscle of young adults. The model can be used to simulate leucine feeding of different doses and timing to visualize the downstream signaling cascade. 

This tool is being developed by the [Clarke Laboratory for Quantitative Exercise Biology](https://www.sfu.ca/clarkelab-bpk.html). Further information on the muscle protein synthesis kinetic model can be found in the following study.
